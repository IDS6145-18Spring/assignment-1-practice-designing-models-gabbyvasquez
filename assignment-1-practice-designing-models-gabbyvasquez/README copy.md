## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

(When it comes to rescuing stary animals from the streets, it can be diffcult to take them from the street due to them being scared of being approached. An artifcal intellgient system will be able to take these animals off the street and to the shelter with ease.)
(My inspiration to do this was because of a cat named Nubs who is an the outdoors cat. She does not mind being approached by others, but when Irma came around, it was diffcult bringing her indoors to protect her from the storm (thankfully, we were able to bring her in to safety). Not many animals are this fortunate to get this type of care)
(When it comes to natural disaters like Hurricane Irma, there has not been much efforts done to bring in stray animals into shelters to be protected. The purpose of this project is to develop an artifical intelligent system that will detect stary animals and bring them to safety. The system will be able to snatch up these stray animals without struggle.)

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(The artifical intellgience will have to detect whether or not they have a stray animal in the visual field. If they detect that the animal is not mirco-chipped and has less than 20% of body fat, the animal is a stray and they are to take the animal to a shelter. If the animal they have encountered does not meet both requirements, they are to take no action with the animal. The purpose of this simulation will be to test how the AI is able to accurately detect stray animals in thier visual field and take them to saftey.)

## Smart City (Safety of the outdoor animals) Simulation

(The following simulation will be implemented through an agent-based simulation. This simulation is best suited for this experiment because it will involve analyzing the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with a view to assess their effects on the system, which in this case, will be in prepartion of a natural disater.[**(Gabby)**] C:\Users\Gabrielle Vasquez\Documents\g.vasquez\Assignment 1\assignment-1-practice-designing-models-gabbyvasquez\analysis
