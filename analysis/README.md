## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(An agent-based simulation will be used to solve this problem)

(This type of simulation will best model what will occur during the process of collecting all stray animals during times of evaulation for natural disaters. We will not only get the chance to predict how animals may react to an AI, but to also see if other factors, for instance, humans will impact the process in anyway.)

(I will use a commerical gaming engine, possibly UnReal Engine, to best create the necessary assests and environment to be encountered.)
